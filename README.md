# Repository for A Study of Scarred Landscapes

This repo is a culmination of my thesis work during 2017-2018.  A more complete set of instructions for how to build a Device will be uploaded here, along with hopefully more organized code.

## Project Description

This project examines how technology has impacted the environment by looking at how we have altered and scarred the landscape by developing an open source multi-layered sensing device which will allow me to interact with the environment in new ways, revealing information about the land we live on.  The device will be a tool of engagement in different landscapes. While it will serve as a scientific tool for collecting environmental data, it will also be an instrument of interpretation as it will create generative sound based on the data collected combined with nature sound recordings of the investigated spaces. Through this field work, I want to find new ways to interact with and understand the planet we live on in order to develop a new kind of relationship with the land while conveying to those who see it that they can do the same.
